# Flutter Rust Audio

I am developing the first framework that will allow folks to build audio plugins, processors and applications using Rust and Flutter, instead of the typical C/C++ and proprietary UI solutions.

### This project is currently being developed in **stealth mode** - please [reach out](https://www.github.com/fuzing) to me if you are interested in participating or learning about this technology

Goals for the project:
- Fast!
- Rust/Dart as the primary languages, and FFI for C/C++/ASM code
- Flutter for the UI (this is novel, as most other frameworks [**JUCE et. al.**] use their own UI library)
- Target all major plugin types (AU, AUv3, VST, VST3, AAX, LV2), and standalone applications
- Target all major desktop and mobile OS (Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android), and web (via webassembly)
- Support for traditional DSP and Neural Modeling
- Device discovery and enumeration
- MIDI Support
- Compilation and Packaging System
- Rich eco-system of DSP algorithms
- Optional outsource of processing to GPU (via OpenCL) on all platforms
- Robust Pipelining/Chaining
- Licensing?
- Did I already say Fast!
