# Flutter Rust Audio

This framework will allow folks to build audio plugins and applications.

### This project is currently being developed in **stealth mode** - please [reach out](https://www.github.com/fuzing) to me if you are interested in participating or learning about this technology

Goals for the project:
- Rust as the primary language, but enable use of existing C/C++/ASM code
- Flutter for the UI (this is novel, as most other frameworks [**JUCE et. al.**] use their own UI library)
- Target all major plugin types (AU, AUv3, VST, VST3, AAX, LV2), and standalone
- Target all major desktop and mobile OS (Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android), and web
- Device discovery
- MIDI Support
- Compilation and Packaging System
- Rich eco-system of DSP algorithms
- Optional outsource of processing to GPU (via OpenCL) on all platforms
- Robust Pipelining/Chaining
- Licensing?

as stated above, this project is currently in **stealth mode** - please [reach out](https://www.github.com/fuzing) if you are interested in participating or learning about this technology
